Fox Cub Games Dev Test - Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game played by 2 players on a square grid of tiles.
Each player has a different symbol (traditionally X or O, but here we have custom images).
When the game starts, each tile is empty.
Players take turns selecting an empty tile and placing their symbol in that tile.
The game is over when a single row, column, or diagonal is completely filled with one Player's symbol.
The player should pick the grid size at the start of the game: 3x3 or 4x4.
No AI is necessary, both players' turns can be controlled by the same mouse input.

We also want to store, in memory, a history of every move played in the game. We don't need to do anything with this data, just store it. Choose the correct data structure for the job.

The game doesn't need to look amazing, but it should look good, even with these simple assets.
Most importantly, the user experience should be solid.

If you have any questions, please ask me.
